    California: Upon cancellation of the transportation or travel services, where the passenger is not at fault and has not cancelled in violation of any terms and conditions previously clearly and conspicuously disclosed and agreed to by the passenger, all sums paid to the seller of travel for services not provided will be promptly reimbursed to the passenger unless the passenger otherwise advises the seller of travel in writing, after cancellation. This provision does not apply where the seller of travel has remitted the payment from customer to another registered wholesale seller of travel or a carrier, without obtaining a refund and such other provider fails to provide the agreed-upon transportation or service. In this situation, the initial seller of travel must provide the passenger with a written statement accompanied by bank records establishing the disbursement of the customer payment, and if disbursed to a registered wholesaler of travel, proof of current registration of that wholesaler.
